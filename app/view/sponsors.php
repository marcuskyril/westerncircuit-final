With the rising trend towards bespoke fashion with its emphasis on hand-made products, discerning consumers are now looking much more closely at the quality of craftsmanship over a mere brand name — and Claude Bernard is no exception, offering timepieces individually hand-assembled with genuine Swiss Made precision movements. Sophistication does not need to come with a hefty price tag as Claude Bernard is a highly accessible watch that is designed for the customer with an eye for refinement. In an era where fast technology and fast fashion reign supreme, the Claude Bernard Swiss Made watch is the panacea for the soul, embodying the art of gracious living for those who take the time out to appreciate the finer things in life — quality, reliability and an undisputed elegance that only a hand-assembled Swiss Made timepiece can offer.</p>

                <h2>Atos Wellness</h2>
                <p>Atos Wellness was founded in 1984 with the aim of “making the world a better place”,

                  is to assist the individual towards bringing the body into balance, thus creating harmony from
                  within. With this, the body is able to heal itself, naturally. Atos believe in projecting the
                  need for harmony within one’s environment as well. This is seen in a bold, unprecedented move
